### Abstract

Recent works have shown the capabilities of deep generative
models to tackle general audio synthesis, including a variety
of impulsive, tonal, and environmental sounds. These works
operate on low-bandwidth scenarios and typically include
pre-trained latent encoders and/or several cascaded modules,
possibly limited by an autoregressive generative modeling
approach. In this work, we propose a diffusion-based genera-
tive model for general audio, named DAG, which deals with
fullband signals end-to-end in the waveform domain. Results
show the superiority of DAG over existing label-conditioned
deep generative baseline.
